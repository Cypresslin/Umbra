Create website showing the explored part of the world with percentage, kms walked,etc

Fix pan (the display is not updated correctly on pan)
Disable animate to location on pan and add an "Where Am I?" button
Have a background task that stores areas explored instead of points walked (concats
areas explored in a  location and a radius for example)
